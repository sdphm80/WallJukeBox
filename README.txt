The wall jukebox is intended to turn a wall of album covers into
a jukebox where you can simply press the album cover to play the songs.

Phase 1:
- Create a basic way to play MP3 Files from a library collection
- Create a GUI that simulates the wall hardware (Lights & Buttons)
- Convert Vinyl records to MP3s (Onging)

Phase 2:
- Arduino Serial interface 
- Read button presses to control album playback
- Connect to hardware to control lights
- Allow lights to have a spectrum analyzer mode

Phase 3:
- Create web interface & basic LCD interface as a secondary means to
  * Control & View Album Playback
  * Modify Album/Song Info

Phase 4:
- Create hardware to handle and playback actual vinyl records
